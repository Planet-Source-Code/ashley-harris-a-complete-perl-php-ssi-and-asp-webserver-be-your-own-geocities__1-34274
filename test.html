Check out <A HREF="aztekBB/index.php">AztezBB</A>, I picked it out from PlanetSourceCode under the php section. It's what I'm using as a base to add php support from (It's the first php script I've seen in my life). Check it out!<P>

Check out <A HREf="quiz/quiz.htm">Jarad Collums's Acronym Quiz</A> (Off PSC). Just to prove that external perl scripts work. Basicly it asks you 20 questions like what is RAM, and has a perl script grade you. preatty cool. (I got 100%! <IMG src="/aztekBB/smilies/coool.gif">)<P>

Check out Kaustav Acharya's <A HREF="aspguestbook/index.asp">Pure Speed Guestbook</A> (Off Psc), what I used to add asp support to this webserver and learning asp in general. Also rather cool.<P>

Check out <A HREF="asppoll/poll.asp">EZ Poll</A> Used as a base for advanced ASP functions (I've had to comment out the set-cookie and redirct code, and I can't edit the poll (no M$ access 2000), but you may get some use out of it.<P>

Check out <A HREF="cgi-bin/pandaemail/viewmail.pl">Panda email</A> I picked a random cgi-script of sourceforge.com, just to see if it worked (I can't get it to work, no POP3 account, but you might). Basicly to prove that you dont need to modify external cgi-scripts to get them to work.<P>
