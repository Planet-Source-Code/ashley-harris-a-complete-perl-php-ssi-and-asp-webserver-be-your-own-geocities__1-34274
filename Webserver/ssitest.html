This is HTML stuff in ssitest.html<P>
Now comes the SSI tag to load a file<P>
<PRE><!--#include file="sales pitch.txt"--></PRE><P>
And that was stuff loaded from an external file.<P>
SSI has a little more power then that! for instance, it is currently: <!--#echo var="DATE_LOCAL"--> and you are viewing the file <!--#echo var="DOCUMENT_NAME"-->, which has a last modified of: <!--#echo var="LAST_MODIFIED"-->.
