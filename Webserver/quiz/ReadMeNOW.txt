	This is a basic example of how to make an online
quiz. The way this works is, it gets the input from a 
webpage form(from combos named 1,2,3, etc.). Then, it 
consults a small database of correct answers and 
compares them to the answers given. For each answer 
that matches, 5 is added to the variable $score. Then, 
a webpage is outputted telling you your score. Sound 
easy? I hope so.

	Too make this work, put the file quiz.html, 
and quiz.cgi onto a perl enabled server. Visit quiz.html
, and take the quiz. Press grade me, and it'll tell you 
good you are at computer terms...simple.
